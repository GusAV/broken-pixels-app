# BrokenpixelsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4. and updated to Angular 7.3.3

This is a personal project intended to training and skill build. The website idea is to be a "Rotten Tomatoes" style website, where gaming critics and players can give their opinions on the lastest releases in the gaming industry. This is an ideia that is still in development, just like the code, a lot still need to be thought and done.

As of now it possible to signin, login, logout, search for games, post a comment and see other comments about that game. The repository is just for the frontend project of this website.
